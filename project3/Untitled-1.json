            "text" : "I really enjoy using my new Brother 1034D overlock sewing machine. I have been sewing for about 12 years and finally decided to take the plunge and get a serger. This machine is easy to thread and sews really well. There are two instructional DVD's that come with the machine. One of the DVD's is for use and care and shows how to thread. The other DVD shows the user how to do different types of stitches. The written instruction manual is very clear and concise. Between the written instructions and the DVD's you will be using your serger in no time! To thread the machine all you have to do is follow the color coded thread paths. I really like the lay in tension when threading. I just made a rhyme of the order of threading; \"lower looper, upper looper, right needle, left needle\" and it has been easy for me to remember. Amazon has the best price on this particular model that I have seen and therefore I ordered it here!",

            "text" : "I am a long-time sewer and have previously owned a Bernette serger, made by Juki, from the 90's. I sewed hundreds of hours, everything from upholstery to lingerie, on that serger and wore it out. A few years ago I purchased this machine, after reading so many positive reviews. My experience, in comparison to what I had been accustomed to with my Bernette, is that this machine is difficult in almost every way. It runs like a tractor, its tension is often in need of adjustment, threading can be a nightmare, it tends to \"chew-up\" light fabrics and I find that I rarely use it. I've gone back to zig-zagging most of my seams and will buy something else as soon as I can. If you are planning on purchasing a serger and are an entry-level purchaser, I would recommend a basic Babylock or Juki. If you are buying a second machine, as I did, I recommend that you save up for a machine that you can enjoy. It might be more money up front, but I've discovered the hard way that you do get what you pay for in a serger. The bottom line is that I wouldn't recommend this serger to anybody.",

But finally on day 3 I rolled up my sleeves, pulled it out of its box and stared at it... Then about 5 mins later I found the two CD's it came with and watch the first one twice, all the way through. This CD is perfect for visual learners like myself! I was serging away in no time and haven't looked back! I've easy changed thread and have only used the one 'regular stitch' so far, but thats all I've needed. As a beginner this machine is heavenly and I'm so pleased with my investment :)",

Changing the thread is not hard at all and I've gotten the hang of adjusting the tension to make different types of edging. I'm so happy with this purchase! I've been using it on knits and also on finishing the inside seams of some clothing, and it really makes a difference in how well they wash.

I first bought a singer which I had some trouble with (the cord didn't want to stay in well). That might have been a fluke, but after seeing the Brother had better reviews and was a bit more versatile I bought it instead of exchanging for another Singer. I am absolutely in love! Also, I've been using this at least several times a week for a few months now, so this isn't a review done based on one or two uses. (I really REALLY love it!)It isn't difficult at all to learn to thread the serger... sure it's more complicated than a sewing machine, but not much, just remember the proper order and take it slow and you'll be fine. I highly recommend watching the video that comes with it, (though it could really stand to be updated) or search the net for another video to help you get comfortable threading it.I am really enjoying the variety of feet, especially the gathering foot! This is such a fun foot!! You can really create some tight gathers by tightening your needle thread tensions as well as using the differential feed.Some comparison to the Singer for those considering both:The easy way you can set the knife on or off is a VERY nice feature. No need to remove what you're working on and interrupt the line of stitching if you come to a spot where you no longer want the knife to cut. Just turn the wheel till it's down and flip the switch!The ability to remove one of the &#34;fingers&#34; to create the very narrow rolled hem is also nice, and very easy to do! I didn't realize this difference till I got the Brother, but I don't think either finger could come off with Singer which would lead to a wider stitch even with only 1 needle thread and the narrowest width. (Though to be fair, I could be wrong about the Singer. If there was a way to do it, it wasn't obvious to me after watching all of it's videos.)It's great to be able to use regular sewing machine needles in the serger!The ONLY thing I preferred on the Singer was the separate screws for each needle. On this machine there is one hex screw that loosens both and despite what the video says, it isn't easy for me to hold one in place while taking the other out (or putting it back in). While this is annoying, it's not a big deal, just takes a little more time and fiddling and seems an odd oversight on a machine that's so full of other nice and easy to use features.My only other complaint so far is that for some reason sometimes when I close the front door/cover it wants to stick out just a tiny bit. This doesn't affect anything, but it annoys me not to be able to figure out why it won't sit flush sometimes and will snap down perfectly other times. Ah well... if it becomes problematic for some reason I'll update the review.",

I primarily sew stretch knits and grew increasingly impatient over sewing zig-zag stitches, pressing them all out meticulously and straining the trim the seams to match.... The clean finish that the knife provides is AMAZING! I rec'd this as a Christmas gift and have been self teaching for a couple of weeks now. Another favorite for me is the rolled hem- as I like to use it on intimates and raw jersey hems. And if you use the 3 stitch overlock- it is literally a two second adjustment to use the 3 thread rolled hem- which can eliminate a standard machine all together!If I could improve one feature- it would only be that the cord was longer- now that two machines sit on my sewing table- the extra couple of inches would really help- but NO BIGGIE- an extension cord works just fine.",

The knife that cuts the fabric as you sew is awe inspiring for anyone who's never used a serger.. I do advise taking on a simple pattern or project to get used to the machine as the functions will take some getting used to,, ie the first one I did had gathers and then you were to sew the top and bottom together with the gathered piece in between and I missed some of the middle fabric and ripping serged seams is NOT a good time.. threading really isn't bad if you give your self time, it comes set up with different colored threads already threaded so if you plan to just use the 4 thread overlock all you need to do is remove spools on the stands, snip off and tie on the new threads and away you go , even rethreading isn't so bad if you take your time to learn what you're supposed to do. The fabric catcher tray seems like a flimsy throw away or lose thing but it's fantastic and catches all of the fabric the knife cuts while sewing. One of the features I like best about this particular machine is that you can use either overlock thread cones OR regular thread spools .. really like that since my nearest fabric store has a limited variety of overlock thread and a fantastic selection of regular thread spools.",

I am using it on a card table so the cardboard maybe absorbing any extra noise. I practiced on scraps for a few days then tied on bigger spools to change the thread. That worked well and I had to remember to go slowly to catch the knots before they went through the eye of the needle. I was a little puzzled with threading the lower looper but after watching the video I was able to figure it out.My local fabric store sells sergers and after talking to the salesperson for a while and watching a few demonstrations, I picked up a lot. One thing that the store did, which I have also done, is place little labels with the names of the levers and dials and instructions for tension up/down etc. on them. This saves me a lot of time without having to keep looking through the book. It is good to try it first with the different colored threads, it really helps to see which dial may need tension adjustment.I wish the light was a little brighter and the scrap box was bigger, but I will probably place a lamp nearby and make something bigger to catch the scraps. I am looking forward to making knits this winter. I removed one needle and the stitch finger(very easy) to attempt blind hem sewing. I did not use the blind stitch attachment because when I tried that attachment, the blind stitch was a bit too long for my taste. I think I need to observe someone using this attachment to give me more confidence. I did hem up 4 pants over the weekend, just plain serging and hand hemming, and they look great.I also bought \"The Complete Serger Handbook\" and \"The Ultimate Serger Answer Guide: Troubleshooting for Any Overlock Brand or Model \" which are very helpful because they are in color unlike the Brother manual. My Hemline Black Studio Collection Serger Tote Bag is on its way and I hope it fits. I has been 2 weeks and I am happy with this purchase, I hope it lasts for years.",

I was so intimidated by it, that I left it sealed in the box until a month ago. It was just the thought of using a serger with all those threads. I thought that if I had it, I might as well use it....and I'm so glad I did! The informative dvd was a life saver because I've never even seen how a serger is threaded let alone done it myself. The best advice I can give you is to use the technique where you keep the machine threaded and tie the new thread to the old ones and pull them through. I am so happy with this machine that I've been recommending it to everyone I know that sews. You can't beat it for the money. The other nice ones are so expensive in comparison and I can't see where they would be any better than this one. I hope this helps=)",

Everything is conveniently located for use and adjustment. The owners manual shows clear details for making any necessary changes to get perfect seams for your project. It tells you how to choose the right stitch and how to set up your machine. There is info on what to change if the seam doesn't look the way you want it.I'm glad that I didn't give up on having a serger because the Brother 1034D has convinced me that serging can be easy and fun! I watched both of the DVDs before trying the machine. That gave me confidence that I could succeed and I have. I now rethread the machine easily and I have sewn several small projects. I like to make baby blankets for charity and this machine will make quick work of those and let me get more of them mailed off to the Reservation.

It just would not chain.When I finally got it working it did a mediocre jopb with uneven stitches and gaps.I have had it for less than two months. I hate it.I sew nearly everyday. I am accomplished and experienced with sergers.The instruction book is as poorly written as the machine is cheap. The instructional DVD is incomplete.I found a video on YouTube that explained how to thread it. The author was just as frustrated as the rest of us with the instructions.It will chain about 5 inches and then one or all of the threads break.I know that this machine is threaded correctly.I live in Mexico and shipped it to my daughter and she brought it to me the last week of June.Visiting a dealer or sending it back is not an option.I have used it successfully only TWICE.Most of the time I am screaming and crying in rage.It is a piece of garbage and Brother should be ashamed.Don't be duped by the Brother name, they obviously have no shame.",

I decided to get a Brother this time, because the favorite of my four sewing machines is a Brother. It's easy to use and very dependable, which is what I wanted in a new serger. I read reviews on multiple websites, and they were consistently good ones. The price was affordable as well. I ordered the machine on Saturday night, and it arrived the following Wednesday morning. I took it right out of the box and set it up. Much to my surprise, I had it threaded and was sewing within a couple of minutes! I could not believe how easy it was to thread! I definitely couldn't say that about my old one! One of the most daunting things about using a serger is threading it and adjusting the tension. Neither is a problem with this machine. It's wonderfully easy to use and produces quality work.Whether you are considering the purchase of your first serger or have been sewing for many years, you can't go wrong with this one. I mostly sew purses, curtains and clothes, and there's just no way I could produce quality items for myself or others without a serger. If you've never had one, don't be afraid of this one! You won't believe what-all you can do with it to make your sewing projects more fun and professional-looking. Whether you sell your work, give it away, or keep it for yourself, you want it to look good and hold up for use. This serger will be a joy for you to use, so go ahead and treat yourself!",

I had the other serger less than a week before reselling it on eBay. I had nothing but problems with it and it almost scared me out of buying another one. After much research and reading every review I could find on every brand of serger ever made. The Brother 1034D had only 3 bad reviews (under 3 stars) on the 30 sites I checked. 2 were because they had a UK plug, which had nothing to do with the machine itself being bad. The other one was from a woman who was a self proclaimed \"sewing goddess\" who had a thousand dollar machine and this one didn't compare to it (DUH!).This serger (Brother 1034D) is so much fun. I have been playing with it for days and still get excited with every stitch I make. The instruction manual is very detailed and easy to follow with illistrations, plus there is a seperate manual that shows you all the different stitches and how to set your machine to the exact tension for each stitch! 22 different ones! Plus gives you ideas on how to make your own unique stitches. It also came with some C.D's that I have not even watched yet.The machine comes prethreaded with colored thread to match the threading guides. It is not as difficult as some people make it out to be nor as complicated as it looks to be. If you can follow directions and you can thread a conventional machine this is a piece of cake. There are color coded numbers for each thread, just follow the numbers. You also get 3 feet, foots whatever you'd like to call them :) One is all purpose which is great! A blind hem foot AWESOME! and a gathering foot that I have not tried yet.Believe me when I say this machine is AWESOME! and worth it to spend a little extra money on qualtity. Believe me I know there are cheaper ones and I have already been there, done that, don't make that mistake. Amazon is the cheapest website to buy it, I also took advantage of the super saver shipping and it was here in 3 days! talk about fast! Amazon also has great customer service and return policy just in case!I HOPE that this review scares you away from other machines and makes you pick this one. I am confident that you will be extremely happy with the purchase as I was, unless you are a self proclaimed \"sewing goddess\" with a thousand dollar serger already :P. This machine is great for the first time sewer to the sewer looking to upgrade. I have already done all the research for you! Now all you have to do is buy it and start SERGING!-LostInSerenity",

My wife found the box outside on my steps and brought it in the house and set it on the table.

            "text" : "While researching sergers, I looked at everything - from the $2k Babylock to the $199 Singer. I debated long and hard. I was really stuck on purchasing a machine with a coverstitch option and from a dealer that would provide me with lessons. Once I came to the conclusion that I didn't want to mess with constantly changing the machine from the coverstitch to the overlock stitch - I wanted 2 seperate machines - it brought me to a much lower price bracket.I purchased this serger because it was the most reviewed of any other serger out there - in any price bracket - on top of that - it got the highest reviews. Also, with all the tutorials out there, geared to this particular serger, I was confident that I would be able to learn to use this with out classes that I was willing to pay so much more for.I am so pleased with this purchase - just like everyone says - you plug it in right out of the box and I was ready to go. I did open the front cover of the machine and study the thread paths before I hit the pedal. And the next day, I did switch all the colored threads to cones, by knotting the new thread to the old. The DVD that comes with the machine is so informative.The stitches this machine makes are so professional looking. I read a lot of online sewing blogs, and I must admit, my beginner serging with this machine looks way better than some of those sewing bloggers out there - they really need to fix their tensions. ;)Keeping in mind that I have never touched a serger in my life, and to be honest, I never really cared to, until recently... with a little bit of studying and online video watching, I found it fairly easy to start this machine up and give all my products a professional look - with very little cost invested. I would recommend this machine to anyone. :)Happy Serging!",

I watched all of one DVD first to get started. When I tied new thread to the ones that came with the machine I was successful with two. I threaded the other two from scratch, much easier to do than tie the little knots. (see what works for you:) I also used a permanent marker to discreetly label the needle colors & thread tree (U,Lo,L,R) I've threaded the machine from scratch three times now and only had trouble when the lower looper somehow lost its thread. If I would have remembered to re-thread the two needles after it in the sequence, I would have saved myself 20 minutes plus the review of the DVD that states the threading order, even if re-threading one needle. The end result from the serger gives a professional vs. \"home-made\" look and is much easier than my former days of finishing an edge with a zig-zag stitch. I look forward to more complex garments when I learn the different stitching options on the second DVD. The DVD's that come with the serger make a visual learner follow along with ease. I also use a make up brush or a micro fiber cloth to clean up finer fabric dust. I think that means I'll have to oil the serger more often, but I don't mind. Plus, with all the extra's it's so easy to dive into serging without having to buy the basics along the way. A true bargain!",

I didn't need it to thread itself. I didn't want fancy bells and whistles.

            "text" : "I think if you're looking at this machine, you're either a) new to serging or b) impressed by the price and interested in the quality. I'm completely new to sergers, but I did my homework before buying this one, and for the price and the performance, this serger has a perfect balance.I was also concerned about being able to figure out how to use it on my own (so many people talk about taking a class) but within a day I felt like I knew it inside and out. It's setup is uncomplicated and I was able to get right to work. There's something to be said about passing over the machine that can \"do it all\" and buying one that just does what you need.1) The \"how-to\" videos are wonderful for the visual learner. You can pick up the same knowledge from the thorough instruction book(s) included, but the videos reinforce the book. Watching the video on \"threading\" once, and following the line drawings on the machine itself, I was able to thread the machine in 5 minutes. (It's really not that hard - it's all color coded and the steps are numbered, but the videos help)2) Included are two additional feet, one for a blind hem/flatlock and another for gathering ruffles as you sew. Together, they themselves are an $60 value. The feet are \"snap-on\" (when I read about that online I instantly thought of breakable plastic, but the feet are primarily metal with some plastic pieces on the blind hem foot) - the \"snap-on\" construction is very easy to use and solid (i.e. nothing is going to snap OFF over time)3) It's very easy to set the tension and the manual has a very clear chart on troubleshooting uneven stitches (with 4 threads, there are multiple things that can be off with the tension).4) The company description says that it does 22 stitch functions, which I think is a little misleading (it does the basic stuff and they show different applications for the basics).THIS IS WHAT IT DOES:1. 3/4-thread overlock (uses 4 threads; best for use with knits or upholstery fabric)2. 3-thread overlock (general use) in two widths - 3mm (using only the right needle) and 5mm (using only the left)3. Rolled hem (great for edges of napkins, pajama bottoms, frilly skirts, etc)4. Flatlock stitch (decorative or flat seams)5. Blind hemTHIS IS WHAT IT DOESN'T DO:1. Coverlock stitch (stretchy stitch with two straight lines on the front of the fabric). If you're sewing for yourself (i.e. not selling what you make), you can fake this stitch on your regular zigzag sewing machine with a twin needle. It's not quite the same, but close enough for me.2. Chain stitch (a semi-straight stitch, similar to a regular sewing machine but easier to rip out (i.e. good for basting) and a good reinforcement for upholstery)Other sergers I looked at that did the coverlock stitch in addition to overlock, etc. had complicated and time consuming adjustments to be made to switch to the coverlock. If you're going to use it a lot, consider getting a separate machine that does it (the Brother model is 2340CV).The one feature the 1034D is missing for me is the ability to do a 3-thread overlock and a chain stitch at the same time - good for upholstery but something available only on a 5 thread machine.5) Nice little things:1. You have the option of using regular thread spools (cheaper and smaller if you don't need 1000 yards x 4 of whatever color you're buying)2. You use regular needles - so you can use them in both your regular sewing machine and your serger3. It's really easy to control speed with the foot pedal - very responsive4. Disabling the knife (that trims your fabric as you sew) is done with just the flick of a switch5. Differential feed allows you to sew any thickness of fabric, line up stripes evenly, etc.",

It was easy to set up and use the first time. The manuals are clear and easy to understand, and the accompanying dvd's helped to clear up any questions I had. Even when one of the sample spools of thread ran out (I wasn't paying attention, I was having too much fun!) and I had to re-thread the entire machine it took less than 15 minutes - and that includes re-watching a part of one of the dvd's.While a serger can't do everything a standard sewing machine can, if you're serious about your sewing, this machine is a great addition to your sewing arsenal.",

I was able to thread it easily (this was my biggest fear) right out of the box, using the helpful diagrams right on the machine itself.I have used this for many projects already- hemming a nylon slip, sewing fleece, hemming napkins (rolled edge), sewing cordurouy for a kids project.... I'm not sure how I got along without one. It goes so much faster than a sewing machine, especially when you figure you are doing 2 things at once- sewing the seam & covering the raw edge. And the results are so professional looking. I only wish I had bought one sooner.It also comes with a very helpful manual showing different kinds of stitches & what settings to use on your machine to get the desired look.The only thing I would caution is that it doesn't seem to like very heavy fabrics (like heavy denim), especially when you get a few layers together, like at a seam. If you are going to be working on a lot of heavy duty fabrics, you might want to invest in a more heavy-duty machine. But, this is a great starter machine, and will do most fabrics with ease.",

These reviews here at Amazon are what convinced me to buy this serger. The unit is made in Taiwan, but they do have Tennessee phone support if you have a problem and they have a web site with Q&A;'s about the product. I used my tax incentive money from BUBBA, so I am hoping some of it went into the local econony, for staff and support here in the U.S.I'm new at serging, but the CD's that came with the serger are very helpful. If you READ and WATCH the CD's, if you are new to serging, it will help you tremendously. There's a lot to learn for us newbies. I also checked out some books in the local library and purchased one book (used, from Amazon) that was recommended in these reviews, \"Sewing with Sergers, the Complete Handbook for Overlock Sewing\" by Gail Brown and Pati Palmer. It is VERY good!I did mark the \"feet\" that came with the unit (and the Elastic Taping foot that I bought separately) with the first letter of what they do with permanent ink, as I am not familiar with them yet.The serger is quiet and easy to use...so far, and FAST. I recommend learning to thread the unit, it's not hard, just unfamiliar. I haven't done a lot of different seams yet, but I am learning. It is exciting to get a serger so I'm on the road to new adventures!! Thank you Brother!!!",

This model seemed to have better online reviews than other brands so I ordered one from Amazon. This serger can't be beat for the price (and Amazon has the best price), it out-sews my new Singer Commercial Grade serger like nobody's business. The motor is quieter and the machine has a precision feel and sound like a high quality sewing machine - sergers are notoriously noisy but this one isn't. It doesn't vibrate and shake even at full speed - I had to keep a rubber mat under my old one to keep it from becoming airborne (LOL). The tension is consistent and easy to adjust for different fabrics and stitch widths. It takes a little extra time to change it over to rolled hem and back by removing/replacing the stitch finger, but is still very easy to do if you read the instructions. I will seldom have a need for it anyway so it isn't an issue with me - the narrowest overedge setting will serve my purpose. It easily converts to free-arm by sliding off the side plate, a feature usually found only on higher-priced models. You can do decorative flatlock with the 3-thread setting, you don't have to buy an expensive 2-3-4 thread model to get that capability. It has a couple of instructional CDs in addition to the book, which would be very helpful to beginners. If you are a beginner, just take time to go through the book page by page until you understand what it does and what each stitch is supposed to look like and don't be afraid to practice each one. I couldn't be happier with my purchase and highly recommend it for anyone just starting out and experienced seamstresses too. It was also recommended to me by a friend who's had hers for several years - she sews full time without any problems from her 1034D and calls it her workhorse. It's a mechanical model so you don't have to worry about expensive computer repairs. Don't let the price scare you off thinking it's cheap quality - I've had three higher-priced models and this is by far my favorite - high price doesn't always insure quality performance.",

Due to the fact that it is priced so well, you can find quite a few blogs that use it and will tell you the settings for the machine depending on what the project is. Definitely a good purchase.",

After reading the reviews here, I decided to take a chance on this machine, and have been delighted. It is truly easy to thread (for a serger). The directions are concise and the thread path is shown on the machine.Recently I was in a shop selling a well known, high end serger. I asked for a demo of the threading on it. This $600 dollar machine was a nightmare to thread compared to this simple Brother. It does not have all the bells and whistles of more expensive machines, but it does what it advertises very well. I feel it was an excellent investment for the price. I gave it a five star recommendation on the capabilities of this machine. I am sure there are more expensive machines that may do more, but for the cost, this is a 5 star purchase.",

The threading instructions are almost fool-proof (I say, almost, because I thought the \"blue\" thread was threaded through something, but instead it's threaded against something, and threading the thread through causes the thread to break every seam), and it's so easy to thread. The one drawback is that the cutting knife isn't as strong as my other serger (which, is a pain to thread, so there's the trade-off) - I sewed into 1 straight pin and the knife broke. It would be nice if Brother would throw in a replacement knife, because things that break usually break at inopportune moments (4:30AM, in the middle of a seam)...",

Amazon site says contact the manufacture for missing parts, or their return department. The return department doesn't have a tab for missing items, only a way to return an item. Just a little frustrating.I'm hoping this problem can be resolved quickly as is usually the case when purchasing through Amazon.UPDATE - After finally being able to contact the Brother Customer Service they required copies of my original receipt, not a problem, however the person on the phone was not very pleasant. This week I received a small box in the mail with several of the missing items, but not all of them. I've tried contacting Brother (again), sent another email letter with receipts and am hopeful that the rest of the missing parts will be mailed.

I haven't had any trouble with it so far. I use the differential feed quite a bit, which saves me loads of time easing and gathering. There is a learning curve on this serger, which is probably true of any serger, but it came all set up with multicolor thread, and that was very helpful in learning how to balance stitches. If you have poor mechanical and troubleshooting skills, maybe it's better to get it at a sewing store so you can get help, but I didn't need any help at all, since the DVD was crystal clear. I use fancy threads through the loopers and all that. Sometimes I do wish I had purchased a fancier serger with the cover stitch, so I could do some special effects that are in some advanced books. I don't know if I would have used those features or not, and don't know how much complexity that would have added to the learning process. If you sew knits or slippery fabrics like satin, a serger will eliminate so many headaches for you. I am very glad I took the plunge and got one, and this was a great first serger for me.",

Having 4 thread spools made me freeze, but it wasn't hard at all if you watch the instruction CD first. so I tried this little machine for the first time and could not believe how easy it was to use, finish of the product looks way more professional! I tied another thread when I first change the color of thread, just like in CD, but my thread broke. I put in new one but did not read my instruction that you must change certain spool first.so my stitch was not coming good at first, but after I read the instructions on how to change the tread, I knew what went wrong, after then, it was piece of cake.Now, I am using this machine not as spare, but as my first choice.

The machine is made of strong plastic and seems sturdy -- you'd have to spend much, much more to get the same machine with more metal components.The serger is easy to thread, but you do ave to finesse the pedal if you want to serge at a lower speed.My biggest complaint is that the instruction booklets (CD and paper formats) could have been a little better written.

I am an etsy seller so having ths machine has made my life easier. I suggest setting it up and using some scrap fabric and expermenting with it before starting a project. It is a little hard to guide curved items at first but it get's easier. The tension on the foot pedal is a little diffrent from my sewing machine and it does not need so much pressure to speed up. I prefer to use the peral barefoot when I wear shoes or slippers I tend to push down too hard. I also suggest to keep a can of the canned air you use on computers handy to blow off dust and thread from the inside, it's faster and easier than the little brush that comes with the serger.

Having never used one before I had no idea what to expect.I approached the machine with timidity; afraid that I would mess it up or that I had just wasted money on something I would not be able to use.You have to understand that I was a (shhhh) Singer-user for a number of years, and although my dh says it's statistically impossible, I say that I tore out more stitches than I sewed in! (If anyone is looking for a machine with a self-minded tension, I have one. CHEAP.)All of those latent fears came back when, NOT ONE, but FOUR thread tensions stared back at me. I put the machine in a chair in a corner of my sewing room with a blanket tossed over it. Just to keep it safe. ;)However, several weeks later, I was \"forced\" into using it when a designer/friend asked me to help her out with some draperies for a client that were overdue. I took a deep breath, peeked under the blanket (darn, still there) and got out my box of scrap material. I decided it was Now or Never. I had to run through the video a few times and read and re-read the booklet. (BTW, If you've misplaced your DVD, Joannaglass has put the series on YouTube.) By trial and error I got the machine threaded right! I began serging my scraps. Then I looked for more scraps. lol. I became a believer, hallelujah!I was a serging maniac. I did such a good job on the draperies, my friend offered me a seamstress job. I won't say that that was due to the serger because I have been sewing for a few years, but my confidence is built up.So, ladies (and gentlemen), dust off those shiny new machines (dig it out of the closet, first) and allow yourself to learn an awesome technique that you will be proud of.P.S. For those of you still reading my 'short story'; I unthreaded the machine, once I got it right, and rethreaded, several times. The directions make so much sense. I got it now! My therapist can take the week off....Just One More Thing...Will consider delivering one FREE Singer, with self-adjusting tension, to anywhere in the world. :)",

On the first day I just read the instructions and practiced threading it and working on scraps.updated July 2012After owning this machine for 6+ years and working on it practically every day, at least every weekend, the screw that holds the needles in place popped out and I can't get it to stay in. Bottom line: the machine cannot be used. For a total cost of under $200, this wonderful machine has paid for itself. I decided to buy a new one instead of hunting down a repair (since I don't have a car and it would be a hassle). I thought I would try a 5 thread machine instead of 4 thread, even though more expensive, but after reading many reviews, I didn't find anything that sounded better than this one. So the bottom line is I re-ordered this model. I also ordered the Brother 2340C Cover Stitch machine which is not a serger but looks like one, and is supposed to provide additional stitches (like hem stitch on knits) not provided by the serger. There are not many reviews for the 2340C and they are mixed, but I am hoping it will work for me. I will write reviews after I have had a chance to use it.",

I'm looking forward to learning how to use all of its capabilities and putting it through its paces.FEATURES & SET UP1. The machine is color coded for each of the four different tension dials and thread paths. This was one of the selling points for me.2. The machine comes already threaded with thread corresponding to the color of the tension dials. Also, the manufacturer has done a test chain and sewn a test swatch. It illustrates exactly what part each of the four threads play in the creation of a four-thread balanced overlock stitch. This is also illustrated next to each of the colored tension dials.3. The tension dials are large and easy to adjust.4. The normal stitch length and width, and differential feed are marked on the dials. It is easy to use these marks as a baseline when making adjustments.5. Two of the three feet which used to be optional (for approximately $25-$30 each) are now included.6. Accessories included with this machine are of very good quality.7. The various instructional media are very helpful.THREADING & OPERATION1. Threading the machine is very easy to do. There are colored guides and illustrations, as well as numerical prompts.2. It runs very quickly and smoothly. It is not much louder than any mechanical (non-computerized) machine I have ever used.3. The knives can easily be disengaged and reengaged with a lever.4. The stitch finger is easy to remove and insert. There is also a storage spot in the front cover for the stitch finger when it is not in use.5. This machine does a very pretty scarf rolled hem.

I had sent the information to a few friends who have been sewing and serging for years, and they all agreed that this was an excellent machine; especially for the price and for the features. Sergers have come a long way in the past few years. My serger came pre-threaded, but the instructions for threading appear easy to follow. I am going to change the thread colors tonight, so I will be trying the \"tie-off\" method as described in the owner's Manual. I still need to look at the CD's/DVD's that came with the machine; I am positive that they will provide even more insight to the world of serging. I also purchased the 2 books that were recommended; The Ultimate Serger Answer Guide: Troubleshooting for Any Overlock Brand or Model (Creative Machine Arts Series)and Sewing with Sergers: The Complete Handbook for Overlock Sewing (Serging . . . from Basics to Creative Possibilities series). Both books have been helpful in getting a greater understanding of my machine and sergers in genereal. I look forward to doing a lot more decorative sewing with my serger. If you know someone with a serger try their's out first, but I guarantee you are going to love it.",

            "text" : "I have been sewing for quite awhile now. I thought I needed very expensive machines when I first started out. I bought a top of the line Babylock in 1994 and it died this year (2006). It had been having problems and when I took it to the repair shop they would clean it up and say there wasn't anything wrong with it. All for $60 each time. I figured, by now, there's got to be something out there that is cheaper and would at least finish off my seams quickly, making my projects so much easier. I did some research and found that for what I needed the Brother 1034D was an excellent choice. My first sewing machine was a Brother and it's still going strong.I am pleasantly surprised at how much this machine can do. I'm sure at some point I'll experiment with all the features, but at this point I'm very happy with what it can do.I don't think it's all that noisy. Compared to my Babylock they are about the same. The thread catcher is way too small. I attached my old one to the machine, but that caused it to vibrate really bad. So after I'm done with a seam, I just swipe it into the trash can. The threading is easy once you get the hang of it. It's easier than my babylock. When I received the machine it was threaded, but the lower looper was messed up (probably in shipping) so I had to fix it. It probably took me about 5 minutes. Just follow the instructions (pictures are very helpful) and there shouldn't be a problem.I guess this is one time that you're getting more by paying less.",

First, if you're serging a narrow seam, the scrap fabric goes inside machine. So, it requires that you constantly open the door and clean out the scraps and debris left behind from the material. Second, the lower looper thread breaks OFTEN! The thread is inserted through a slide out mechanism that is supposed to make life easier, however, the thread gets stuck after a couple hours of serging and breaks off. SO, you have to stop, rip your partial seam and re-thread. It's very tricky to get the thread inserted properly so that it doesn't break again, and again, and again.By the way, the first of these sergers I received froze up after 20 minutes of use. I returned that and replaced it with this one. Should have purchased another brand. I have a Brother Disney embroidery machine that is also absolute junk. Will NEVER buy another Brother product.",

It's completely different from my sewing machine b/c there is no gradual speed. It's all or nothing. Is this normal? It's absolutely impossible to sew a curved seam b/c I have no control.

I know many extremely talented people who have been sewing for many years and who have owned this and other (much higher end) sergers that told me about this serger and urged me to buy it. I would never buy something this cheap and expect it to hold up for more than a few months without the countless positive reviews I received before buying this.I have owned this for a month so far and used it about a dozen times. I have done a rolled hem and sewn knits and wovens. I have tried the 3 and 4 stitch. Everything I have done on it has turned out perfectly. There is definitely a learning curve if you are not used to a serger. Sergers are much faster than sewing machines. This serger is no louder than any other I have heard. It has suction cups on the bottom which keep it stable and dont let it 'walk' off the table while serging. It comes with 2 manuals and 2 dvd to show you how to operate and thread it, and also all the extra features that it does. The dvds are also on youtube for easy reference.I have heard about the horrors of threading sergers and was very nervous about it when I got it. I have re-threaded this machine quite a few times while changing threads and it is extremely easy. It has an easy to follow threading guide on the inside of the cover which is fool-proof. For the first time, the dvd and the manuals show clearly how to do it.This is the only serger in this price range that I would consider trying. There are other, more expensive sergers that I have heard great reviews on and that have extra features. However, this one has everything you actually need from a serger and anyone wanting to try a serger will be more than happy with this one.FYI - the serger came with a quick-order sheet to order new blades. The price on the sheet is significantly lower than any blades I was able to find online (I dont need new ones yet, I just wanted to know how much they were).",

I keep it clean (with vacuum cleaner and also compressed air to blow out debris) and oiled and it works flawlessly. All adjustments and settings are easy to implement. Some people find overlock machines difficult to thread, and recommend tying old to new thread rather than re-threading the machine. This machine is SO easy to thread, I find re-threading to be faster and more simple. Yes you have to use tweezers in a few places but they are provided and once you get the hang of this machine, it goes very quickly. The lower looper threader is very easy (watch the included video clips).After using this machine for several months, I wanted something with more capabilities and was very disappointed with other machines I tried: the Viking s15 and the Singer ProFinish (which although vastly different in price are mechanically the same machine, made in the same factory but with different plastics and included accessories) -- both of which were terrible (unreliable, mechanical problems). Trying inferior (and yet more expensive) machines made me realize what a great value the Brother 1034D is. It can't do everything, but it does a lot -- and very reliably.The only negatives are: it's a bit noisy compared to a regular sewing machine, if you're not used to that -- BUT it works twice as fast, so that shouldn't be a big deal; and there's only one screw for both needles so removing one while keeping the other in place (to do a 3-thread vs. 4-thread overlock) requires a bit of dexterity, but is not so bad once you're accustomed to it. Also because of the design of the machine your stitches are limited to the edge of things (there's no room to the right of the needles/loopers, even with the cutter disengaged).For those who want to sew stretchy fabrics or otherwise want their projects/garments to look professional, without spending a fortune, this is the machine you want.",

            "text" : "After doing a lot of research on this serger, I purchased one in June 2011 with the intention of giving it as a gift. It sat unopened in the original box (after all, who opens and uses someone else's gift?) until early December, when I learned that it wasn't needed as a gift. I opened it, watched the DVDs, read the manuals and a book on serging, and on 12/15/11 tried to use it.The loopers collided and wouldn't move. A phone call to Brother tech \"support\" resulted in my being told that the service warranty expired after 90 days from purchase, and that I would have to take it to the local authorized Brother service place. I was told that damage probably happened in shipping. I have the original box, which bears no evidence whatsoever of damage.I asked to speak to a supervisor, and was told that Cindy Horne would call me back. This was on 12/15/11. I have yet to receive a call from Ms. Horne.I had to spend $125 (62% of what I paid for the machine) and drive a total of 70 miles to/from the repair shop to have a brand new, straight-out-of-the-box machine repaired. The repair man said he had no explanation as to how the parts he had to adjust came to be out of alignment, and that one of them locked or screwed in position so that it could not shift or move unless deliberately manipulated from inside the machine. In other words, the shipping damage Brother's customer \"support\" tech tried to cite as the cause of the problem couldn't feasibly be the cause.I would have been mortified had I given this item as a gift, only to have the recipient have to spend $125 to get it fixed. I'm furious that I've had to pay to have a brand new item repaired, and that Brother's customer \"support\" can't even be bothered to honor the promise of a callback. I am also extremely disappointed in Brother, as it was a brand that I had trusted until this experience. I have had several Brother items (printers as well as sewing machines), and they performed like workhorses. However, they were older Brother items, not recent products. I suspect that as with so many other companies, Brother has decided to produce on the cheap, and once they have your money, no one could possibly care less whether or not the product performs--even straight out of the box.My advice is this: If you buy a Brother item (which I can no longer in good conscience recommend anyone do), do not take it for granted that it will work. Do not buy in advance of a birthday/holiday/whatever, and do not expect Brother \"support\" to be of any help at all.",

I opted for this inexpensive machine because I thought it wouldn't be too much money lost if I didn't like it. I wish I would have gotten it a long time ago. It comes pre-threaded and it was very easy to start using it immediately. When I endeavored to change the thread it got a bit tricky. Threading the lower looper is the hardest part. Sergers are complicated machines. The manual is good when trouble shooting tension problems. The threading was still a bit hard even following the manual closely. I haven't used the included videos too much but my husband helped me and he said that he had better luck with You Tube tutorials than he did with the included video. The tie-off threading method is usually pretty successful. Since I have never tried any self-threading models I'm not sure if that feature is worth the extra money. It didn't come with the elastic foot so I bought it separately since I sew leotards. I haven't had much luck using that foot yet. It works great just doing samples but it is hard to control the exact fullness desired with a specific length of elastic/fabric. I ended up giving up on the \"elasticator\" and instead baste the elastic into the leg openings with my conventional machine to place the fullness exactly where it is needed and then overlock it in place using wooly nylon in the loopers. I think this is a great machine for the money and would highly recommend it. I might consider someday upgrading to a serger that has a coverstitch option. I think this machine is definitely worth the money and a good place to start.",

Just take your time & read thru the directions bc after that you'll never have to look at them again-it's that easy!! One caution is that you REALLY do HAVE TO thread it in the right order, they aren't just saying that bc it will rip a hole in time & space ;-) I found it a pain to have to unthread all the way to where you have to rethread & thread it all back again but they are all like that I think. The motor is quiet & it doesn't jump around all over the place. It's very smooth & gentle to your fabrics. My only issue is that I haven't found the thing you are supposed to use as a guide to line up your fabric properly but maybe that just comes with experience? Oh also the top cutting knife is great! Even on my delicate fabrics it never pulls or anything like that-also when you don't want it, it's super easy to turn off, just flip the switch!

Don't get this just because of price....you will be sorry you wasted your money and put yourself through such frustration. My Bernette functioned flawlessly for 20 years, this one hasn't functioned for 20 minutes.I've since purchased a Viking and will not even donate this to anyone...it goes in the junk pile and tallied under waste of my money and allot of time.",

Within days, I was a comfortable with this machine as my Janome sewing machine I had also purchased and was soon making clothing, bags, jackets and so forth. I opened an etsy shop and have used the two machines consistently since. I have used and abused it. I take it apart every six months and clean it. The only trouble I had with it was to be expected give the use, was the presser foot was no longer holding the foot down. I am a do-it-yourself-er, so I took it apart and followed the shaft up you'd see a plastic white part that presses the foot down. The plastic was worn from use but could be adjusted to make contact once again. Also, do yourself a favor and don't mess with the timing. It is almost impossible to re-sync.

I've had no problems or issues with it at all. I think for someone starting out serging, it is the PERFECT machine at a GREAT price. It flows easily, and serges beautifully.

My previous serger lasted four years before just finally wearing out. I would never waste the money again on a more expensive serger because I can wear it out just as fast as I can wear this one out. This little serger seems to never require repairs - just blow the lint out of it and keep going. In the past, I always had problems with my commercial sergers which typically cost two to three thousand dollars each.

This Brother 1034D Serger is, if anything, easier to use than my sewing machine!-It is fully threaded (albeit with small spools of low-quality thread) right out of the box, so you can \"plug-n-play\" right away.-It comes with very nice instructions as well as an instructional disc and all the accessories to do almost any project.-It is compact - about half as wide as my Singer Brilliance sewing machine and around the same depth - so they fit neatly together on my sewing table. I can sew, then serge, then sew again without moving everything around.-It is easy to thread, despite my initial fears. As I noted, I began serging right away, so I was able to put off learning to thread the machine for a while. when the dreaded time came, though, I found the instructions and thread guides made the task quite straightforward, if still more complex and fiddly than a sewing machine.In a few days with this machine, I've already moved from straight lines to curves and corners. The machine moves smoothly and quickly, making large projects much easier. This is, overall, the perfect serger for anyone who wants to start serging with no experience and get things done right away. I have no complaints so far about my Brother 1034D Serger.",

Now, I could kick myself because it is very easy to thread if you view the CDs that come with the machine and read the manual. You can also look at the vids on YouTube about how to thread. Probably for those new to serging, the lower looper threading might seem to be the hardest. Just remember to follow the blue lines on the machine carefully and bring the thread under the upper looper.I can't say enough about this machine!! I'm still learning things and it has added a new level of creativity to my sewing. This machine does not have a cover or chain stitch so if you're looking to do a lot of sewing with knits, this machine may not be as useful to you.

            "text" : "I've been sewing since I was 6 years old. I make fashions for myself and others. However, I've secretly feared \"the serger\" for years. I've quietly been hiding my fear by avoiding wearing any of the knitwear I've made. My conventional machine is a top of the line Viking with many features yet I've never been happy with finished look of knits made on any conventional machine. They just can't match yet alone exceed the look of RTW knits. The purpose of my lengthy introduction is to support my high rating of this entry-level serger. I had no problem dropping $1500 for a conventional machine but was not prepared to make such a big investment for something I might hate. I'm an experienced seamstress who's obviously missed the boat on the necessity of a serger. Before choosing this serger I did my research. I've read reviews here on Amazon and several other sites about it taking into consideration everything users had to say. Many people wrote about the user's manual and software and were disappointed it them. I was so excited when it arrived that I didn't even look at the software. I read the manual, removed the sample thread, re-threaded it, and was serging in 30 minutes!! Everything on the machine is marked by color and number. Try to forget every frightening thing you've ever hear about it and jump in. I think the fear factor has made many seamstresses look for monsters in the loopers and needs. My ONLY problem has been that I'm used to the presser foot lifter being on the left not the right..big deal. Biggest thing to remember is to thread it in order no matter what. Few people want to change thread but if you take your time and literally follow the numbers, you'll be serging a sample in 5 minutes. I've tested scraps of every type of fabric I could think of and made the adjustments as the book describes and everything's been perfect. Yes, it's a bit loud but putting a rubber mat underneath it helps a lot. I was lucky enough to get a new one on Amazon for approximately $180 delivered. It's worth every penny and more. I'm only mad at myself for waiting so long to enter the world of serging. It's cut my construction time in half. I won't be buying any RTW knits anymore. I've had it for a week and I've completed 3 projects though I work full-time. I've gushed enough, gotta sew.",

            "text" : "UPDATETwo years later and this little serger is still working great. It's a real workhorse. Makes beautiful rolled hems. Adjustible tension and differential feed results in easy gathers. Still lovin it.When my 14 year old Pfaff serger began acting up I began researching what was happening with sergers. Here's what I learned.1. Pfaff, Viking and Singer are all owned by the same company now. Customers are not pleased with the dumbing down of the Viking and Pfaff sewing and serging machines. I tried out the machines and found that the prices on the low end machines (Pfaff and Viking) were much higher than the Brother but did no more. Checked the internet on Bernina, saw no better features and knew that Bernina was always the most expensive of all machines, so I just moved on.2. Wanted an auto threading machine (Babylock) but did not want to spend over $1200. Also, I had no use for the extra stitches. (If I were going to buy a high end machine, it would be a Babylock due to its auto thread tension and auto threading).3. Bottom line is that the now low end machines are better than my old Pfaff mid priced serger. No point in paying for repairs.4.Finally, for the Brother Serger -- Thought I would try it and send it back if it was junk. It's GREAT. Looper threading is much easier than my old machine. It has a free arm which my old machine did not. The Brother only takes about one second to remove the stitch finger to switch to narrow 3-thread overlock or rolled hem and sews these beautifully. I haven't tried the gathering foot yet, but I had to buy that foot extra many years ago and it is a foot I use, so nice bonus to have it included with the Brother. The Brother is no louder, nor does it vibrate more than the $1000+ machines that I tried in the stores.5. Bottom line,I needed a serger to do 3 and 4 stitch overlock, gathering and rolled hem. This Brother gave me exactly what I needed for a great price. Couldn't be happier.",

I called Brother, and they referred me to an authorized repair shop-- the closest was 45 minutes away. I called the repair shop, and of course it is not an easy fix, and they told me they would have it for as long as three weeks. Thankfully, this gift was purchased on Amazon, and they swiftly offered to send me a replacement machine and return label for the broken machine. Hopefully I'll have better luck with the next machine. What a disappointment to have my only Christmas gift arrive completely non-functional.",

The four thread stitch still allows plenty of stretch to my spandex fabrics and made these two dresses total successes.I was really worried about threading the machine. The good news is there are lots of good instructional videos on YouTube. (The videos that come with the machine are old, out-dated, and only run on Windows computers. They are worth a quick look, but the YouTube videos are much better.) Even better, it comes with four reels of thread already in place. This was enough to make both dresses. The best tip: when you almost run out of one thread, tie a new thread onto the end and let it run right through the machine. Works right up until you get to the two needles. The other two threads have no needle eyes or problems.If you are a beginner, like me, I think this machine will help you with those stretchy fabrics.",

            "text" : "I had this machine on my Christmas list, and finally was able to afford it about 4 weeks ago. I got it in the mail, and like all the reviews say, it comes threaded and set up to use. It was great. I made a shirt the first night I had it out. I made a skirt the next day, with a nice lettuce edge. I edged two large pieces of tulle with a napkin hem. Great - beyond some weird thread breaking issues on the lower looper. I know how to thread this machine inside and out now.But - and here's the kicker. The very next time I went to use it (for a Mother's Day gift no less), something was wrong. It wouldn't cut anymore. Looked like the knife possibly broke, and the knife lever didn't work. I called Brother - they referred me to a local repair shop. After researching said local repair shop, it appeared to be very shady - and my sweet serger didn't deserve that. Plus - it was a new machine! I shouldn't have to take it in on week 2 of ownership. Not my problem - I have little kids at home and driving a 2 hour round trip to take a new broken machine in is ridiculous to consider! At least the Brother rep was somewhat apologetic. Sort of. I returned it to Amazon as defective. I cried over it too..Round 2 -I replaced my first machine with the same model, and pledged to myself that this was it - if this one breaks, that's it. Two \"lemons\" in a row, and I'm done with this brand. Well, the machine came, and I opened the box. The thread had all bounced off the bobbins - bad sign that it was juggled a bit in shipping. I set it up to run, rethreaded it (not too bad, by the way - the lowerlooper is the tricky part), and got to work. And it squealed like a pig. Seriously! There was no purr, it howled in pain when I ran it. The access door on the front would barely open too. Seriously? What are the odds??? My decision was instantaneous - either take it to the hole in the wall repair shop or return it - I returned it the next day. I killed 2 machines in 3 weeks.Moral of the story? Buy a cheap serger, expect it to act like a cheap serger. Some people (most it appears) are lucky, and don't have this experience. Not me. I've since test driven better quality machines, and I know what to look for now. I'm saving for a more expensive, reliable, non-Brother machine. Sorry, the bad experience ruined me. If a sketchy repair shop is all you can offer me, I'm going to look elsewhere.Other moral? Before you buy an expensive machine like a serger, with lots of mechanical parts, buy it locally and from a reputable dealer. Most (if not all) local shops offer warranty work and their own protections for your machine if something goes wrong. When you buy online, you have to send to the service hub in your area, as Brother doesn't offer any other option for internet purchases. Also, most shops over an upgrade policy - turn your machine in within a time period towards a better machine. A great deal if you ask me.Just something to consider, if you are going to use the serger more that a few times a year.",

By the third time I've changed thread spools, I can now thread it without needing a reference. There's also good videos on proper tension adjustment. Once set, this machine shines.The cutting blade is very sharp. You need to watch that, a small mistake with fabric bunching under the foot will slice giant holes in your project, I'm so glad the blade has an easy way to turn the cutting feature off.I haven't used the differential feed much, other than testing to understand why it's there. The free arm feature is great for cuffs, and other small items.If I had any issues, it would be the lack of a proper cover stitch, but I like this machine so much, I'm considering purchasing a 2340cv to make up for that omission.Thank you Brother, this is a very solid machine, and it's available at a great price.",

But I am starting to branch out and sell my sewing projects, and felt like I needed a serger for a more professional look. Everyone said \"It'll change your life!\" But I was scared by the stories of threading nightmares, etc. Decided to take the plunge on this Brother machine based on the price, but mostly because of the rave reviews. I think I'll be very happy with it. The threading wasn't really hard at all... I just followed the steps that are right on the machine and consulted the manual a couple of times.(Didn't look at the DVD; wasn't sure if it would work on my Mac.) Tried it out on several fabrics and it looked pretty good! I can't wait to try the different stitches. Plus kudos to Amazon for a great price and fantastic service (it arrived in five days).Update: I have since taken a class (one three-hour session) to get some hands-on training... this was very helpful in deciphering the manual and all the attachments and understanding exactly what functions this machine can do. I still have had no issues in threading, but now I know better how to adjust the tension to make the perfect stitch. I'll reiterate that it's a great machine for the money.",

            "text" : "Last night at 8pm, right at the start of Glee, I opened the huge square box that my Brother serger machine came in. It was nicely packed and the machine was much bigger than I had imagined. It came prethreaded with corresponding threads to the 4 color coded thread passages. It came with a CD to view on my PC. I paged thru the book for 10 minutes to familiarize myself with things and then popped the CD in my computer. I only watched the first 5 lessons as I didn't want to go into overload trying to process things I didn't need to get started. I will go back to watch those videos when I need those features. I watched the threading lesson 3 times. Then I set the machine up on my kitchen table. It was 9pm. It took me 15 minutes to thread the machine with my own new white large spools. I purchased 4 white and 4 black. Even though it takes regular spools of thread, I figured I would stock up on the 2 colors that I would use the most. And @ $2.99 each, they were a bargain and ensured I would not run out of thread for a while. I used the tie on method that is explained in part on the enclosed video. Finally satisfied and confident that I was ready to start, I gently pushed the accelerator to stitch on some scrap fabric. I was pleasantly surprised at how smooth the machine ran and the speed and ease of mobility. The default tensions settings worked for me so I didn't touch them, but I did experiment a bit with the stitch length and width settings. So here's the good news. By 9:25, (one hour and 25 minutes total) I had begun to sew the bodice and belt ties of DGD's christening gown. I really like the machine and encourage those of you who have one, but like me were overwhelmed to get started, to do just that. Open it up and see what it can do. To those who have always thought of buying a serger, I say do it.There are a couple things that I feel need improvement though.1. The video and the manual contradict each other regarding the How To Thread process. This is the most important thing on a serger - getting it threaded correctly - and it's not 100% clear. The manual says to ALWAYS thread the Upper Looper, Lower Looper, Right Needle and Left Needle IN THAT ORDER. In the video, the instructor starts with the left needle. I think it would be helpful to remember the following sequence (using the color code) that occurred to me last night. GBPY - GaBippy! Green, Blue, Pink, Yellow is the threading order.2. The seam allowance guide is not explained anywhere that I could see. Being an experienced sewer, I kinda figured it out, but I could see how it could be a problem for beginners. The raised bolded line to the right of the needle is the standard 5/8\" seam allowance. The line to the left is either 3/8\" or 1/2\" and then the one closest to the needle is either 3/8\" or 1/4\". I will have to measure the stitching with the knife blade recessed in order to get a more accurate definition of the seam allowance guide.3. The manual says to oil your machine, but then does not include the oil.4. The machine gets filled with lint from the fabric very quickly. I recommend getting a can of compressed air (available @ office supply stores) and give it a good blow out after you're done sewing.",

            "text" : "Purchased this item after reading such awesome reviews & being a newbie to the world of serging. First thought upon opening the box? This thing is CHEAP! Very much like a child's home sewing machine, the parts are a whimsy plastic and far from sturdy. The machine itself? Epic FAIL. Having my own clothing line, I am well aware of how to use a machine or two. I also am well aware of how to read an instruction manual prior to using, as I always do. This being said, I attempted every single thing this machine promised to deliver and came to the conclusion that it is sub-par, at best. The seams are not even, the needle in the \"lower looper\" continuously drops the thread mid-project, leaving me with these hideous gaps. The tension guidelines in the user's manuel are completely off, so make sure to try every single seam on a piece of scrap material first. Bottom line? Waste of $$ on my part; I prefer something more sturdy, reliable, and efficient. This is good for home-sewers who aren't planning to sell any of the finished product, but definitely not for those who want a super-professional finish. Use common sense, there IS a legitimate reason why this machine is priced far lower than other sergers on the market --you get what you pay for!And the kicker? I contacted Brother about this issue and was told that it sounds like it needs repair, as this is common... less than 60 days after I purchased it. Quite frankly, I'm not interested in this brand any longer --stick to typewriters and leave the sewing machines to Janome & Singer!",

After reading several good and bad reviews for this product I decided that I would take a risk with it. I'm glad I did.I just graduated with a four year fashion design degree, and I would not have made it through my senior year studio without this serger. I specialized in custom designed wedding dresses and this surger's ability to create rolled hems on really delicate and thick fabrics, resulted in a beautiful finished product. Once I discovered the rolled hem function on the machine, I rarely ever surged anything; the rolled hem just seems to look so much cleaner on a finished product. You do have to adjust the threads a little and get use to it with each different fabric you use. Unlike some of the really expensive fancy machines I was use to in the lab, I found that I did have to do a couple of practice stitches and make sure the tension was correct when switching fabrics. After those few practice stitches and some minor tweaking, the machine produces a nice finished edge.I usually get really frustrated at threading sergers and this was one of my biggest concerns when looking to purchase a serger. This machine is incredibly easy to thread and has wonderful color coding instructions.Overall I highly recommend this serger. It produces quality work and is highly worth the money.",

When replacing my sewing machine a couple years ago, I happened upon a brother sewing machine, and absolutely adore how easy it is to thread. It definately renewed my interest in sewing and I have happily sewed many a project since that purchase. Recently I decided to replace my old serger so I checked out Brother to see if I could find a serger that would be easy to thread and use...low and behold I luckily found this one, and I am so very pleased.This serger is a dream to thread with its color coded and numerical system which is marked right on the serger. I did it once, and I don't think I will even need the manual to do it again. This serger performs beautifully. The instruction manual is full of information and the two cd's give you additional visual information to make this serger live up to your dreams.I am very happy with the purchase of this serger, and if you are hestitant at all to buy it, you shouldn't be!

However, my best friend has this same model, and she does nothing but rave about it! My fianc&eacute; bought me my own for Christmas, and now I can't believe I waited so long to use a serger.This serger arrived already threaded, with a piece of test fabric to demonstrate that the threads were chaining together properly. I promptly un-threaded the machine, and taught myself to thread it from start to finish. This is the heart of understanding your serger - once you can thread it, you're nearly there.I read the manual carefully (I downloaded the PDF version from Brother's site so I could zoom in on the images) until I was fairly clear on the thread tension and the feeding system. Then I found some scrap fabric, plugged it in, turned it on, and tried it out. It serged perfectly!I experimented with the tension settings a bit, to see what the fabric would look like if the tension was too loose or too tight. I really recommend this experiment to first-timers, because it's invaluable for troubleshooting down the road.This serger is a bit on the loud side; however, my friend's grandmother's $1,500 serger is not really any more quiet, so I don't see this as a negative. It's an intricate, heavy duty piece of machinery, after all.I do wish Brother had been more careful and had labeled the extra feet that came with the serger, and had included a Mac-friendly DVD (or obvious instructions on where to find the videos online).

It took me 2 hours to figure out how to thread the machine when ALL I had to do was tie my thread to the already threaded colored spools if I hadn't pulled them off. I wanted to jump out of a window. The video is very helpful BUT it doesn't show much about adjusting the tensions for particular problems. I used the manual for that and I'm still not 100% sure I got it right. Threading the lower thread is by far the most difficult. It is EASY to mess threading up and it is intimidating. Now that I've FINALLY figured it out, I think I could do it again. I advise only opening the box when you have 2 hours and are feeling patient to figure it out. I was rushing during my son's nap and hoping to get as much done as I could before he woke up. I should have waited for when he went to bed... and I had a glass of wine. Now that it's up and running, the seam is nice, crisp and it's easy to use. I think I will use this white thread until it is absolutely necessary to change colors... I'm already dreading having to thread it again!",

Simply follow the color coded thread guides. The handbook and included dvds give good instructions for threading.I've only had this serger for a few weeks now but I'm very pleased with it. It is user-friendly and not too difficult for a beginning serger to learn to use.I only gave it 4 stars because I think that the guidebook is a little confusing. On the bright side, there are lots of serging tutorials to be found online and they are very informative.The machine is 5 stars for those that are already accustomed to using a serger.

            "text" : "I have been using an old (20 yr) serger but decided to treat myself to a new one when it came time to get it adjusted yet again this year. For slightly less than two years charges of adjustments I have gotten a machine that is far above what sergers used to do.Last weekend I made a set of draperies and bed skirts using both a heavy fabric and a light-weight one. The Brother serger went from one to the other and back again without adjustment and looked wonderful in both cases. My suggestion is if you are using an older serger, treat yourself to the new features like lay-in threading and easy to thread lower loopers that were plagues of the older sergers. If you are looking for a first serger this one will fill the bill. I like it so well I went out and bought me a new Brother 6100 Sewing Machine to go with it.",

If you get one with a foreign plug, as in one review after this one...please see that you get Customer Service at AMAZON, and I know they will help you out with that.I was afraid of sergers, never having operated one, even though I have sewed for decades and own a sewing machine. The deal on this serger at AMAZON is so good though, that I purchased. I have never seen this excellent level of instructions in any other machine I have ever purchased. And I mean not just sewing machines, but anything. The box includes two CDs...minor critique here - why not do it on DVD?? Well, even though they say they are for Windows 95 and above, the CDs mount on a Mac and all you have to do is play the MPEGs and you have the instructions. The only thing the Windows PC will do is autorun the CD, and provide a menu which you then must click anyway. I made myself a guide to which order to play the videos in, and use it on my Mac! In addition to the basic CD, there is another one that has a refresher of the basics, plus illustrations of several other techniques. Both CDs are done by a woman with an excellent style of communication. In addition, there is a complete print manual, and you can download a pdf of this manual from the Brother site. All in all a great start. I watched the videos about ten times, then I began to serge. The machine runs fast and smooth, and I am looking forward to many hours of fun!

I am very happy with this machine and would recommend it to anyone wanting to buy a serger. I have had little to no problems, and the problems that I've had have only been operator error ( i.e. the thread tree not being pulled all the way up!) I have waited this long to write a review, because I truly wanted to put this machine to the test. My current project is a set of eight patio cushions. These are made from a heavy cotton weave material and include cording around the edges of each cushion. Yes, I have serged through four to five layers of this thickness of fabric, with no problems.Threading this machine is idiot-proof because of the diagram on the inside of the machine, and it is color coded, they couldn't have made it any easier for us! But, I rarely need to thread it completely. I generally clip the threads up by the thread tree, change the thread cone, place the thread condom over the thread cone, thread the thread through the hole in the thread tree and then tie a square knot with the old thread. I do this for all four of the threads and then run the stitching out until the new color serges. The square knots do not effect the serging at all.I hope this review is helpful to anyone thinking about purchasing this product. I'm a happy customer!",

However, the included manual and software made it easy peasy to get started on this machine. Brother has truly constructed an idiot-proof serger, and I mean that as a very sincere compliment. It arrives all set up with color-coded thread, which is threaded through the corresponding color-coded loopers/needles, and each step in the threading process is numbered and marked with a detailed diagram that makes what you are supposed to do crystal-clear. A monkey could thread this machine. In addition, there are plenty of spiffy features like free-arm capability, differential feed, and a retractable knife. I have only used this machine to do basic four-thread overlock stitching, and have not delved into the more elaborate types of stitching it is capable of, but it comes with a CD-ROM devoted solely to the plethora of techniques you can use with this serger. As for performance, the stitches are consistent, the noise level is very reasonable, and it's pretty compact. All things considered, the only complaint or criticism I have is that the included software is designed to be PC-compatible only, however, if you have a Mac (like me), you can still access the all-important how-to videos contained on the CD-ROMS.

I had the old school fear of 'SERGER\" and had relied on my hard core Janome to over stitch my work. My sister in law talked me into the 'SERGER' a year or two ago, and this was my first.I can say that the machine is reliable. Aside from the shipping issue I experienced with it (my first arrived with foot lever broken off and had to be returned for replacement) it works very well every time I use it. I knew the limits of its scope when I purchased and I bought it because I was new to the genre and wanted something simple. If you are a home sewer or low key professional, this is a great machine for you.My only complaint is the threading system. I use very high quality thread because my garments are made to be heirloom and my home styles are meant to withstand years of machine washing. The stitches are consistent ONCE YOU GET IT THREADED. If you own this machine, you will know that step nine of the first thread asks you to catch a pulled out clamp, or reciprocal, then go to another hole. My machine requires six or eight tries to make this work, even on the lowest tension. Wrap, pull, poke,and thread the other 4, then find out it isnt caught on #9 and cut thread and start again. God forbid you change thread or break one because it will take half an hour to get this clamp to work.",

            "text" : "I am relatively new to serging, and I did quite a bit of shopping around before deciding to buy this one. I have been taking fashion construction classes at the local community college and thought that I would likely invest in a machine similar to those used at school. I assume, rightly so, that they know what they're doing and would outfit the school with good, durable machines: Bernina, Baby Lock, etc. After looking at all these other brands, as well as their prices, I thought that I would minimize my investment in my first serger and give this one a try... everyone's high ratings gave me a lot of confidence. I have to say, right off the bat, that I was impressed the moment I opened the box. This is a solid, well-constructed machine that ships loaded with accessories and instructions. I get the sense immediately that Brother is proud of this machine and is determined that their customers will be successful and enjoy using it. I know that sounds kind of corny, but I am impressed from the get-go that I get so much from Brother for such an amazing value. Mine contains 2 CD's of instructions and techniques, which I didn't even expect. The CD's are a little dated (made for Windows '95) but were easily accessible on my Macintosh. The machine also arrives pre-threaded. The machine, as well as the instructions, really lay out how each part of the machine and threading work, and how to get the best results for different kinds of finishes. I've yet to find something negative to report about this machine, but will update my review should I run into any problems. For now, full steam ahead!",

This Brother serger is easy to thread and color coded with all the extra feet. Great price. The only thing is tension. I have to learn more about tension. This serger it computerized somewhat. Every time I change the tension, it won't adjust right away. Then if I continue to sew for about 10 minutes then it adjust to what I set for. So be careful to test on the scraps after you change the tension. I wish Brother International company will fix this tension problem and make it better for easier to use.

The Brother serger has as good stitch quality as the BL. It doesn't have the jet air threading or the automatic tension features, but it is easy to thread and easy to set tensions on this machine. The instruction booklets do a great job in walking the sewist through both.I can't believe this works so well and is so easy to use. There are a couple of stitches that the BL has and the Brother doesn't, but they are not very important to me (for example, blanket stitch).On the other hand, there are a couple of features I like better on the Brother. One is the free arm and the other is the presser foot lifter, which is easier to use and more conveniently located than the one on the BL.The quality I like least on this serger, and the reason for the four stars, is the noise and vibration it generates at higher sewing speeds. It is better when I sew at a moderate speed and with a thick pad under the serger.Other than that, I find it hard to believe Brother can sell this machine at this price. It is a true bargain, with good quality and design and one of the lowest price tags of any serger on the market.",

Even with proper oiling it's loud!!!I bought this machine to use as a second serger to my small apron business. I figured it would be easy to thread for those aprons I choose to change the color of the thread. Well, yes it is easy to thread and adjust. But, the negatives about this machine out weigh the positives.Secondly, the knife doesn't not adjust on this machine unless you totally don't use it. Third, the feed dog on this machine is rough to thinner fabrics and can easily rip your fabric. Even with adjusting the pressure to the feed dog.Thirdly, the engineering of this machine makes it easy for the fabric that is being cut to fall in the machine and jam it. A real pain!!My Juki far outweighs this machine in both engineering and ease of use. And yes I would love the opportunity to return this machine!",

            "text" : "As someone who worked for a few years in a costume house, where I had access to industrial machines and never-ending cascades of fabrics and threads for all my personal projects, the absence of a serger in my home life has been devastating to my productivity. I knew I wanted a serger, but I had a very limited budget.The Brother 1034D 3/4 Lay-In Thread Serger is a great choice for an affordable, simple serger. The brand is a familiar one, and the 3/4 feature comes in handy. Fixing the tension is easy, and the adjustable thread holder arm on top is great for saving space. It has a lot of useful stitch features, the suction cups on the bottom keep it stable on my table, and it is relatively quiet (nice for apartment dwellers).I can't speak for people who haven't used a serger before, but I found changing threads on the machine to be easy and stress-free. The little numbers around the machine mean you know exactly where the thread goes next. It came with four different colored threads set up, so you can see which position makes what component in the stitch, and so you can follow them easily through the machine while learning rethreading. Actually, I liked the fun look of four colors and ended up using them on two or three projects until they ran out.If you are experienced with sergers and don't mind the four colors of thread you can be serging immediately. I think I was working on the machine within 15 minutes of opening the box. I haven't watched the tutorial yet, and haven't needed to.",

I finally decided to add one to my craft/sewing room, and chose this Brother model because I love my Brother sewing machine, and the Amazon reviews looked good.Oh my goodness, I pulled this out of the box and it looked quite daunting. I set up the machine, and read the book to the point of a practice run. Lo and behold, the machine was jammed. The wheel wouldn't turn. I called Brother so that if the machine broke while I was trying to fix it, I hadn't done anything that they did not specifically tell me to do. Brother told me to turn the wheel counter clockwise to try and break it free. Fifteen seconds later, the machine was working, and I had my test run. Awesome!I finished the book and watched the CD. The CD contains great instruction for all the different stitches, and is very easy to understand. I will give you this recommendation up front as it comes in the middle or toward the end of the CD somewhere. Watch the CD by your serger. Have practice material handy. Have some 4x6 cards or sometthing and take notes of the settings and instructions that are given on the CD, pause the CD and practice the stitch and then file the practice stitch with the notes that you took. I wish I had this reference, but I am going to have to watch the CD again to create this. Otherwise, you will have to watch a portion of one of the CDs again to get the instructions. It's a little disruptive if you are in the middle of sewing.I had read reviews of other brands of sergers and the nightmare of threading them. People spending four hours to try and figure out how to thread them. I was a little fearful of this machine. After watching the CD, I was relieved that I really would never have to thread it again since you can just tie new thread to the already threaded looper. Well, I wasn't paying attention and the upper looper (#3) ran out of thread. I easily rethreaded this in a matter of moments, but in doing so, the lower looper (#4) came unthreaded. Uh oh. I read the book and easily got it threaded up to where it goes into the looper. The book seemed to show a bunch of dashes, which made no sense. I turned the page and the book clearly explained the last steps. Awesome. Had the lower looper threaded in less that 60 seconds. Bwahaha. I am now fearless with this machine. It is easy to use and the CDs are great references. I have only had my machine for about 3 weeks, but I have used it every day and just love it. It's a great price too! I recommend this for anyone looking for a 3/4 serger. Don't get tricked into buying a more expensive machine by people calling it a 'beginner' serger. Silliness. I sew daily, and have for 30 years. This is a 3-4 serger. A 3-4 serger will do almost anything you need it to do unless there is something special that you sew regularly that requires a chain stitch or a coverstitch, although I can't for the life of me figure out what that might be. If you add the 2 thread and the 5 thread option, you will spend a whole lot of money for a coverstitch, jet stream threading and and a chain stitch. After alot of research, my assessment was that I might make up a few projects to use the extra stitches if I had them, but that it was a whole lotta money for something I didn't need in order to make clothes or dolls or doll clothes or quilts. A bunch of money for novelty. This is a great machine with alot of functionality. It is a real time saver for finishing seams, raw edges, rolled hems, pin tucks, blind hems, etc. Awesome!",

            "text" : "I've been using my 1034D serger for several years now. For sewing stretch knits, it's indispensable. I spent a few months trying to get my ordinary sewing machine to do something reasonable with spandex--from using wash-away stabilizers to twin needles--and it was an exercise in frustration: missed stitches, inconsistently gathered seams, and tight seams whose thread broke on use.I finally ponied up for the 1034D, and I haven't looked back. (I mean, I still use the conventional machine for lots of things, of course, but not seaming spandex!) It produces gorgeous, stretchy, durable seams, and fast! It's also handy for making quick seams in wovens, but that's just icing; for spandex, there's really no other sane way to get the job done.For hems, you can use either a conventional machine's zig-zag (where skipped stitches are still a challenge for some fabrics), use the 1034D to make a blind hem, or (if you can tolerate the idea of yet another machine) get a coverhem machine -- I eventually ended up with a Janome 900CP. But if you had to choose one tool for working with stretch knits, it'd be a serger, and I heartily endorse my 1034D.",

I'm a long time seamstress and have used dozens of sergers over the years, and this little honey does it all. It worked perfectly right out of the box, granted I know what I'm doing, still that does not guarantee a sewing machine will be cooperative.One huge surprise has been that this machine is easy for my daughters to use as well, they are ages 11, 9 and 6. Granted they aren't threading it, but they don't hesitate to sit down and finish the edges of their 4-H projects at all. The first couple of times they were nervous about the blade, but the last time my middle daughter cut a pattern out, she had a little excess fabric hanging off of one piece and I told her to get the scissors, and she told me not to worry the serger would snip it right off \"finger snap\". So there you go, out of the mouths of babes.Threading any serger is a real pain in the fanny, this one is no different. But the directions in the manual are very good, just follow them to the letter. So if you buy this serger (or any serger for that matter) put the instruction manual in a safe place and where you can grab it quickly.",

The instructions were not too clear as to how to thread it but once I realized how it was done it is a piece of cake. An added plus is the fact you can use ordinary spools of thread.

            "text" : "I have never used a serger before, and in fact, am not that hot of a seamstress. I'm mainly self taught, and I never really learned to read a pattern, so tend to craft things of my own design..but hadn't really sewn in a lot of yeras. I have reached an age where all clothing in stores either looks like it belongs on a ten year old, a twenty year old, or someone from 1978...I don't wear bright clingy florals. No thanks. So, I decided I'd try my hand at sewing again and design some clothing for myself that was drapey, and cool, and decidedly not for a 20 year old. My problem is that I love linen, however the frayed edges and lack of finished look I was getting on my regular machine was getting to be a drag....I am also quite lazy about seam finishing. Been looking at sergers for several months now and after reading all of these reviews, decided to take the plunge.The box arrived damaged, which freaked me out. But the inner box was fine. However, as some other reviewers noted, the four color threads looked like a spider had been busy in the box! I didn't even bother unpacking it as I was afraid I'd tangle things further. I wonder if the company ought to perhaps tape these spools down so that they aren't all pell-mell enmeshed around the edges of the box on opening?That day, I got on the phone and found a local fabric shop that just happened to be teaching a serger class that weekend. BOY oh BOY!!!! So I signed up.Best thing I could have done. They spent all day teaching myself and several other students with equally tangled up machines the basics of the whole shebang.And let me tell ya! I got this baby home and serged me some clothing!! A lovely pair of frilly legged bloomers, a little t-shirt, and a simple skirt! And they don't look like Lucy Ricardo ran them off on her machine because Ricky wouldn't let her buy a new dress!! Once I had the basic know-how down; it was so easy to use!I do think that you need both the serger and a regular machine, as it won't do some things, straight stitching or piecing one thing to another in a traditional way, for instance.So yes....threading once learned, is easy. Sadly, I found no CDs in the box, so it was a good thing I found the class. Perhaps they are no longer including them as all of this is available online? (which seems a bad idea as not all people have access to the internet.) I even knew how to remove the little key in order to do the rolled hems etc...This was SO easy to use that three of the other women in the class I took (a class of only five) are purchasing the machine to REPLACE their far more expensive Singers, Janomes, and Babylocks. Amazing! Even our teacher said she would now, having seen the machine in action, be recommending it to users who had not purchased one.I don't write a boat load of reviews, but I'm writing one as the other reviews here were the tipping point for my own purchase...I would purchase this again, no hesitation. But I'm hoping for years of happy sewing.",

I've already completed 3 projects using the various stitch capabilities. Each time I change thread color I make it a point to re-thread from the beginning just for practice. The included CD's provide additional visual instruction and are worth viewing.

Well, we took a chance on this Brother model and found that it is the greatest machine. It performs exactly as we expected and operating it is very simple, if you only read the instructions and have a little patience, when learning the how-tos of operating this Brother 1034D Serger. :-)",

            "text" : "OVERALL COMMENTS:1. The machine runs smoothly, without too much noise.2. The guts of the machine all appear sturdy/solid; some of the superficial plastic parts scare me a little because they look like they could break easily. In particular, the extendable thread guide (thread tree) on top of the machine.3. The machine arrived, ready to use. This was a nice benefit because it allows you to try it out instantly. Everything was well packed.4. The fact that it uses regular sewing machine needles and thread is a plus in my mind; save money in not having to stock up on multiple sets of accessories. Note, however, that due to the differences between a serger and a regular sewing machine, there will probably be instances where you want to buy different threads for each machines, depending on the specifics of your project.5. The machine comes with a number of nice accessories, manuals, and instructional videos. I found the manuals and videos are OK, but not great. More about that below. NOTE: The videos DO NOT work on my MacBook Pro, but I was able to view them on someone else's PC.The rest of this review is for those, like me, who have never used a serger before.Like many other reviewers, I've thought about getting one for years, but was intimidated by them (they looked so complicated). Also, they were quite expensive. I would classify my sewing skill level as just beyond beginner. On top of that, I've only recently taken it up again after not doing any sewing in maybe 10 years. The biggest frustrations I've had with my 10-15 year old Singer clunker are a) finishing hems easily and with a professional look b) sewing knits. So, I decided to check out the serger market, and was surprised to find one in this price point, and with encouraging reviews from other novices. So I decided to give it a try. I've had mine for about a month now, and other than experimenting with it, I've completed one garment. I love the ease of use as well as the results. This did not happen without some pain, however. But I believe you learn more from your mistakes than from anything else, so I feel better for having gone through that.The first thing I did when I received the machine was untangle the threads (I left the machine threaded, I just worked the thread from the spool side of things). I looked through the videos and the manuals I did a couple of practice runs (without changing any of the settings) on a piece of basic cotton fabric; everything was great!Then I made what might be considered a mistake to some: I went from there to trying to do a rolled hem on a very thin, gauzy fabric. I created quite a mess, the threads got tangled, the results weren't right, and of course, the thread kept breaking and I had to rethread many many times. I got quite frustrated as I kept referring to the manuals and the videos, but just couldn't figure it out. Then I went to the internet for help. What a life saver! In particular, a video on You Tube called\"Threading a Brother 1034D Serger\" by \"ArtistkaeSewing\" who made this video specifically because the Brother instructions were so difficult to follow. This saved my day! I actually had to re-thread many times until I got all the adjustments right for the rolled hem, so while that was frustrating, I am now a pro at threading the machine from all the experience I gained. In hindsight, it was probably not a good idea to work with a fine fabric and a special stitch for my very first project. : )I also recommend a book called \"The Complete Serger Handbook\" by Chris James. I find it fills in many many gaps in my knowedge (since I am a beginner to serging) and it does so in a very easy to follow format with lots of great illustrations.Here are a couple of other tips from someone who learned the hard way:1. I didn't pick up on any instructions anywhere on where to line up your fabric while sewing. It may be there, but I just never noticed. Unlike my regular sewing machine which has a guide line labeled \"5/8\" - the serger just has some subtle slightly raised lines in the plastic area in front of the needle ... with one of these lines thicker than the others. That's what you want to use.2. I didn't realize that my thread tree was not fully extended which I unpacked it. For sewing on regular fabric, it didn't seem to make a difference. But when working on the rolled hem on the gauzy material, I believe this was one of the main reasons why my thread kept breaking.Maybe these tips will save someone out there some frustration.Overall, I'm very happy with it. I know enough to use it for basic functionality; I will just have to learn the other features as I go. I'm glad to have one successful project under my belt to boost my confidence. I am glad I bought it! I feel I can now bring my sewing skills (and results) to the next level.",

Read the instruction book and I recommend highlighting in color the sections for each thread. I did not find the CD-Rom helpful. I recommend you buy Nancy Zeiman's book on serging. Just make sure that you thread in the correct order - green, blue, red then yellow. Once I figured that out I was fine. If you are not used to adjusting tensions, you may find dealing with that a little frustrating at first but review the instructions and make samples. My sewing machine is a $3,ooo Janome so I was really please with the subtantialness of the Brother. I did not find it excessively noisy and I didn't think it vibrated a lot. I have sew drapes and several other things and never had the thread break. I think this machine is a good deal.",

I heard stories about how hard it is to use sergers and how difficult they are to thread. Like other reviewers, I unpacked it, looked over the manual, watched all the videos and got going. I even took some extra pictures of it threaded so I had them for reference for when I needed to thread it. I felt comfortable with the machine in a couple of hours. I also used my label maker to label the thread paths and side controls to make it more user friendly for me. I started my first project (simple pillow cases) and the sample thread broke. I took all the thread out and rethreaded it with my own thread. It took me just a few minutes to do it the first time. I thought, why do people make such a big deal out of this? My only suggestion is for Brother to improve the video so there are closer shots showing the detailed areas when threading and the manual could be better, but both are ok and not so bad they will stop you.

Last year I did my first coat which was challenging and I certainly learned a lot, but while it looked ok on the outside, the inside has a lot of raw edges. Over the last month I've been making a robe. I saw a pro friend use a serger and got interested in it, but didn't want to spend a thousand bucks. When I recently looked at the lower priced models, I was apprehensive. Would they break? Were they versatile enough? I've liked other Brother equipment -- I have one of their printers -- but a serger is a whole different machine. After reading a bunch of reviews on the Brother 1034D, and in the middle of this project and facing doing a lot of hems and finishing work, I took the plunge. Boy am I glad I did. I got it last wednesday; today is sunday and I finished the robe. Rethreading the serger is not hard, but practicing on scraps is absolutely invaluable. I did a blind hem with the included foot, which took more practice to get right. I finished all of the interior seams and edges in minutes, and the results look great. I'll be able to go back to the coat and finish it off with the serger. The time I saved and how easy it was to get good results more than made up for the price.

I've been intimidated by sergers in the past and even returned another brand after many hours of not being able to figure it out. I have had great success with this one. I like for my work to look finished on the inside and this machine does a beautiful job of that!! I am very glad I decided on this serger and would highly recommended it to anyone!!",

I wasVery pleased with how quickly my serger was delivered and how easyit was to thread and sew with. I was happily sewing along when I wentto raise the presser foot and the handle broke! I was right in the midstof finish some Christmas pajamas....I called Amazon and they very politely and quickly gave me the address ofthe nearest repairman in my area and paid to get it fixed, no hassles ordelays. I would not hesitate to buy this machine, it sews very well, quietand smooth.....just don't put too much tork on the presser foot handle becauseit is made of plastic.Other than that I really like the machine and look forward to many yearsof use.",
